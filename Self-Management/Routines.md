# Morning & Evening Routines

## Overview

Routines create predictable anchors that support focus, energy, and well-being. Morning routines set the day; evening routines support wind-down and recovery. They’re a practical application of [Habit Systems](./Habit-Systems.md).

## Why Routines Help

- **Reduce decision fatigue** — Fewer small choices frees mental energy for important work.
- **Signal state** — “This is focus time” or “This is wind-down time.”
- **Build consistency** — Repeated actions become habits and compound over time.
- **Protect priorities** — Block time for health, reflection, and deep work before the day takes over.

## Morning Routines

### Goals

- Wake at a consistent time when possible; see [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md).
- Activate body and mind (movement, light, hydration).
- Clarify the day’s priorities (top 3 or key blocks); see [Planning Ritual](../Productivity-Techniques/Planning-Ritual.md), [Goal Setting](./Goal-Setting.md).

### Example Elements

- **Wake and hydrate** — Water, avoid phone-first if it causes stress.
- **Movement** — Stretch, walk, or exercise; see [Exercise](./Exercise.md).
- **Quiet / focus** — Reading, meditation, or planning; see [Meditate](./Meditate.md), [Review & Reflection Systems](./Review-Reflection-Systems.md).
- **Most important work first** — One deep-work block before email and meetings when possible; see [Deep Work & Focus](../Productivity-Techniques/Deep-Work-Focus.md), [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).

### Tips

- Keep it short and doable (5–30 min) so it’s sustainable.
- Stack new habits on existing ones; see [Habit Systems](./Habit-Systems.md).
- Adjust for chronotype; see [Energy Management](./Energy-Management.md).

## Evening Routines

### Goals

- Wind down so sleep quality improves; see [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md).
- Close the loop: quick review, tomorrow’s list, then disconnect.
- Create a clear boundary between work and rest; see [Work-Life Integration](./Work-Life-Integration.md).

### Example Elements

- **Shutdown ritual** — Review done list, write 3 things for tomorrow, close tabs and apps.
- **No work after X** — Set a cutoff; no email or messages except true emergencies.
- **Relaxation** — Reading, light activity, time with others, no screens before bed if possible.
- **Consistent bedtime** — Support sleep; see [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md).

### Tips

- Same idea as morning: keep it short and consistent.
- Use alarms or calendar reminders until the routine is automatic.

## Customizing

- **Length** — Start minimal (e.g. 3 morning steps, 2 evening steps), then add.
- **Content** — Match your goals: more movement, more reflection, or more planning.
- **Flexibility** — Routines serve you; adapt on travel or off-days rather than dropping entirely.
