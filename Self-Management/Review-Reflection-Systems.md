### Personal Productivity Metrics

What to measure so you can spot trends and adjust (without obsessing):

- **Output** — Tasks completed, key deliverables shipped, or goals hit; align with [Goal Setting](./Goal-Setting.md).
- **Focus** — Deep-work hours or blocks completed; see [Deep Work & Focus](../Productivity-Techniques/Deep-Work-Focus.md) and [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).
- **Time use** — Where time went (meetings vs. focus vs. admin); adjust via [Prioritization](../Productivity-Techniques/Prioritization.md) and [Meeting Effectiveness](../Productivity-Techniques/Meeting-Effectiveness.md).
- **Energy and well-being** — Sleep, stress, or energy levels; see [Energy Management](./Energy-Management.md), [Stress Management Techniques](./Stress-Management-Techniques.md), [Burnout Prevention & Recovery](./Burnout-Prevention-Recovery.md).
- **Learning** — Skills practiced, feedback received, or reviews done; see [Learning & Knowledge Management](../Personal-Development/Learning-Knowledge-Management.md) and [Feedback](../Interpersonal-Development/Feedback.md).

Keep metrics simple and review them in your weekly or monthly review; use them for course correction, not self-judgment. See [Planning Ritual](../Productivity-Techniques/Planning-Ritual.md) for tying metrics into planning.
