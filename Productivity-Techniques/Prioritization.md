# Prioritization

## Overview

Prioritization is choosing what to do first (and what to delay or drop) so your time aligns with impact and goals. It works with [Goal Setting](../Self-Management/Goal-Setting.md), [Task Management](./Task-Management.md), and [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).

## Why Prioritization Matters

- **Limited time** — You can’t do everything; order and trade-offs matter.
- **Impact** — Not all tasks have the same value; focus on high-leverage work.
- **Stress** — Clear priorities reduce overload and guilt about what’s left undone.
- **Saying no** — Prioritization gives you a basis to decline nonessential work; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).

## Frameworks (Summary)

Detailed methods live in [Task Management](./Task-Management.md); here’s the map:

- **Eisenhower Matrix** — Urgent vs important: do first, schedule, delegate, or eliminate.
- **MoSCoW** — Must / Should / Could / Won’t for this cycle.
- **Impact vs effort** — Do high-impact, lower-effort items first when possible.
- **ABCDE or similar** — Rank by importance; work in order.

## Daily Prioritization Habit

1. **Connect to goals** — What outcome or goal does this task serve? If none, question whether to do it.
2. **Choose a small number** — e.g. Top 3 for the day, or “one must-ship” plus 2–3 next.
3. **Do the hardest or most important first** — When energy is highest; see [Energy Management](../Self-Management/Energy-Management.md) and [Routines](../Self-Management/Routines.md).
4. **Review** — In [Review & Reflection Systems](../Self-Management/Review-Reflection-Systems.md) or [Planning Ritual](./Planning-Ritual.md), ask what was prioritized and what slipped; adjust.

## Saying No to Good Ideas

- **Backlog, don’t drop** — “Not now” with a place to capture (someday/maybe, next quarter).
- **Criteria** — Align with goals, capacity, and impact; say no when it doesn’t fit.
- **Alternatives** — Suggest someone else, a smaller version, or a later time; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Everything feels urgent** — Use importance (goals, impact) as the main filter; see Eisenhower in [Task Management](./Task-Management.md).
- **Reactive only** — Reserve time for important-but-not-urgent work (planning, learning, relationships).
- **No review** — Priorities drift without a regular check; use [Planning Ritual](./Planning-Ritual.md) and [Review & Reflection Systems](../Self-Management/Review-Reflection-Systems.md).
