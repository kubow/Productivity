# Deep Work & Focus

## Overview

Deep work is focused, undistracted effort on cognitively demanding tasks. It produces more value in less time than fragmented “shallow” work. This note covers the idea (e.g. Cal Newport’s *Deep Work*), how to protect focus, and how to reduce context switching and monotask.

## Deep Work vs Shallow Work

- **Deep work** — Analysis, writing, design, coding, strategy, learning. Requires sustained attention and minimal interruption.
- **Shallow work** — Email, admin, routine meetings, quick decisions. Necessary but easier to batch and limit.

Productivity improves when you schedule and protect deep work instead of letting the day default to shallow work.

## Protecting Deep Work

### Schedule It

- Block fixed deep-work periods in your calendar (e.g. morning); treat them like meetings.
- Start with 1–2 hours; expand as you build the habit.
- See [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](./Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).

### Eliminate Distractions

- Turn off notifications; use Do Not Disturb or focus mode.
- Close tabs and apps not needed for the task.
- Optional: separate device or profile for deep work only.
- See [Digital Minimalism](./Digital-Minimalism.md) and [Concentration](../Personal-Development/Concentration.md).

### Create Rituals

- Same time, place, or short routine (e.g. “coffee, then 90 min block”) to signal “focus mode.”
- See [Routines](../Self-Management/Routines.md) and [Habit Systems](../Self-Management/Habit-Systems.md).

### Communicate Boundaries

- Make blocks visible; set expectations (“I’m in focus mode until 11”).
- See [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md) and [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md).

## Monotasking and Context Switching

### Cost of Context Switching

- Each switch has a “reload” cost: attention and working memory need to re-engage.
- Frequent switching increases errors and reduces depth; it favors shallow work.

### Monotasking

- Do one task (or one type of task) per block.
- Finish or pause deliberately; then switch only at block boundaries.
- Use [Concentration](../Personal-Development/Concentration.md) (e.g. Pomodoro) to reinforce single-task blocks.

### Reducing Switches

- Batch email and messages to specific times.
- Batch meetings (e.g. “meeting days” vs “focus days”); see [Meeting Effectiveness](./Meeting-Effectiveness.md).
- Keep a “parking lot” list for ideas that pop up so you don’t leave the current task.

## Depth and Quality

- **Clarify the outcome** — What “done” looks like for this block.
- **One thing at a time** — No multitasking inside the block.
- **Increase block length gradually** — Build stamina for 60–90 min or more.
