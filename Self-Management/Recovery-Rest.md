# Recovery & Deliberate Rest

## Overview

Productivity depends on sustained energy, not only hours worked. Recovery and deliberate rest—based on ideas from *The Power of Full Engagement* (Loehr & Schwartz)—replenish physical, emotional, mental, and relational capacity.

## Why Recovery Matters

- **Energy cycles** — Performance drops without regular recovery; rest restores focus and judgment.
- **Sustainability** — Pushing without recovery leads to burnout; see [Burnout Prevention & Recovery](./Burnout-Prevention-Recovery.md).
- **Quality** — Rest improves decision-making, creativity, and consistency.

## Types of Rest

- **Physical** — Sleep, movement, stretching, reducing sedentary time; see [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md), [Exercise](./Exercise.md), [Posture](./posture/Posture.md).
- **Mental** — Downtime without work or screens; breaks between focus blocks; see [Concentration](../Personal-Development/Concentration.md), [Energy Management](./Energy-Management.md).
- **Emotional** — Time with supportive people; activities that restore mood; boundaries; see [Stress Management](./Stress-Management-Techniques.md), [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md).
- **Social** — Time alone if you’re often “on,” or connection if you’re isolated; see [Work-Life Integration](./Work-Life-Integration.md).
- **Creative / sensory** — Nature, art, music, or play that isn’t work-related.

## Deliberate Rest Practices

### Micro-Recovery (Throughout the Day)

- Short breaks between focus blocks (e.g. after Pomodoro or every 90 min).
- Stand, stretch, walk, or breathe; avoid stacking meetings back-to-back.
- Buffer blocks between deep work and meetings; see [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).

### Daily Recovery

- End-of-day ritual: wrap up, list tomorrow’s priorities, then disconnect.
- Wind-down routine before bed; protect sleep; see [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md).

### Weekly Recovery

- At least one full day (or equivalent) off from work.
- Restorative activities: hobbies, people, nature, rest.
- See [Work-Life Integration](./Work-Life-Integration.md) and [Review & Reflection Systems](./Review-Reflection-Systems.md) for weekly review without overworking.

### Longer Recovery

- Vacations and longer breaks; plan handoffs and coverage.
- Use time off to actually rest, not only to “catch up” on life admin.

## Building Recovery Into the System

- **Schedule it** — Block recovery and breaks in the calendar like meetings.
- **Protect it** — Treat it as non-negotiable; say no to encroachments when possible; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).
- **Rituals** — Simple routines (e.g. end-of-day shutdown, weekend transition) signal “work is off.”
