# Brainstorming blunders

The morning meeting with your colleagues kicks off well. You start generating some ideas and gradually get into a moderate flow. There are the practical “no-brainer’ ideas, the crazy “out-there” ideas and all sorts of varied and interesting ideas in between. Things look promising. But then what happens? Any number of things can occur to knock you and other team members off your creative stride. Usually, the ideas will dry up and fizzle out. Or they become that little bit too wacky for your liking, so you decide to stick to the ‘safe’, less risky options: “Let’s keep doing what we’re doing but make it better and faster!”

Or
*“Let’s go with the same design but re-package it in purple this time.”*

Perhaps you or other members of the team automatically begin nit-picking and analysing the ideas, taking your attention away from creating any new ones.

***“Someone’s already done that”***
- ‘Our customers/ colleagues won’t like it’
- ‘It’s not our style’
- ‘We did/tried that last year’
- ‘It’s a great idea but we can’t afford it’

Or maybe you fall prey to a fearful, extra-negative outlook which blocks your ability to see the potential in certain ideas and causes you to dampen everyone’s enthusiasm.

***“That would never work.”***
- ‘It’s against our policy’
- ‘Sounds hard/tricky/complicated’
- ‘Nothing like that has ever been done in the industry before, it would be a complete waste of time and resources.’

Sometimes you get lucky, and the right idea comes bounding in early during the process. There’s no point in carrying on with the brainstorming session. You’ve already got your perfect solution – or have you?

You start taking action on your idea only to find that you didn’t think it through properly and it simply won’t work in reality. Because other suggestions were not given a chance, you can get stuck with seeing the first idea through, otherwise you will have wasted all that time and effort. We talk about “thinking outside of the box” and the box represents all your existing assumptions, habits, biases and default thinking routines. In brainstorming, the box can show back up and block your creativity. Knock it out of the way. No box means your mind can remain fully open as the process unfolds.

# Brainstorming steps to take

You can use the tool of brainstorming or “ideanation” to come up with some possible ideas to solve a problem or issue. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Identify objectives**
Think about the problem/s you are trying to solve. Are there any wider constraints to address – if so, note them down and list by importance. Your top priority should be the focus of the brainstorming session and will give the session focus:

2. **Set a time limit**
Setting a time limit for your brainstorming sessions can be helpful for keeping discussions on topic and encourage team members to maintain momentum. For the purposes of this exercise, the brainstorming time limit should be set between 10 and 15 minutes.

3. **Write everything down**
When the ideas are flowing, it’s important to keep track of what is being said. Assign a group leader and use the collaborative white board or chat. If you were in person, you’d want to use post-it notes and spread them out across a table or board. Note ALL ideas. Again, if in person, you could make use of visual aids and make mood boards and sketches or use Lego to help make the process more creative.

4. **Be open to the ridiculous**
For brainstorming sessions to work, everything is a good idea – i.e., a “bad” idea can provide the stimulus for a GREAT idea. Being open to the ridiculous also creates a sense of ease within the brainstorming team because nothing is discounted.

5. **Avoid group think**
Groupthink is the practice of thinking or making decisions as a group, resulting typically in unchallenged, poor-quality decision-making. It often occurs where a group of people conform, out of a desire for harmony. Individuals are reluctant to challenge ideas because they want to minimise conflict as much as possible.

This creates a barrier to creative thinking and honest communication, while also preventing critical evaluation of ideas. Usually, in these situations, there will be one influential leader of the group, leading the discussions. While the rest of the group nods on in agreement.
One way to minimise the impact of groupthink is to appoint a moderator to encourage critical evaluation, through positive reinforcement.

6. **Get specific**
At the beginning of a brainstorming session, it is a good idea to take a scattergun approach to the ideas process. The idea is to create as many ideas as possible while exploring all avenues and possibilities.

Once you have gathered plenty of ideas and you feel like you have considered all eventualities. You then need to home in on the best ideas from this process. Begin by eliminating the least relevant ideas until you have a shortlist of the very best.

You can then take your best ideas and begin exploring each of these in greater detail. You could do this by breaking into smaller groups, or by taking them one by one. This will help to identify the most viable suggestions from the session.

7. **Sharing the results**
Great ideas are usually the result of a huge team effort – they are inspired, shaped and influenced by a number of groups and individuals. This is why it’s important for you to share the results of your brainstorming sessions outside the group.
This will provide an opportunity for the ideas to be developed and refined even further, until they become a fully formed innovation.
