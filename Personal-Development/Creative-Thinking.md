# Creative Thinking

## Overview

Creative thinking is generating new ideas, reframing problems, and finding alternatives. It supports innovation, problem-solving, and adaptability. Influences include Edward de Bono’s lateral thinking and design-thinking practices.

## Why It Matters for Productivity

- **Better solutions** — Alternatives beyond the obvious first answer.
- **Problem reframing** — Seeing the real question can save time and effort.
- **Innovation** — New processes, products, or ways of working.
- **Learning** — Connecting ideas across domains; see [Learning & Knowledge Management](./Learning-Knowledge-Management.md).

## Practices

### Reframing the Problem

- Restate the problem in different words: “How might we…?” “What if we couldn’t…?”
- Ask “What’s the real goal?” to avoid solving the wrong problem.
- Invert: “What would make this worse?” then avoid that.
- See [Decision-Making Frameworks](./Decision-Making-Frameworks.md) for structured choices once ideas exist.

### Generating Alternatives

- **Quantity first** — Brainstorm many options before judging; defer criticism.
- **Constraints as triggers** — “What if we had half the time? No budget? One person?”
- **Analogies** — “How does another field solve something like this?”
- **Combination** — Merge two existing ideas or solutions.

### Lateral Thinking (de Bono)

- **Provocation** — Deliberately say something wrong or extreme to escape usual patterns (e.g. “What if customers did our job?”).
- **Random entry** — Pick a random word or image and force a connection to the problem.
- **Six Thinking Hats** — Switch modes: facts, emotion, criticism, benefits, creativity, process; see [Decision-Making Frameworks](./Decision-Making-Frameworks.md).

### Divergence and Convergence

- **Divergence** — Open phase: many ideas, no judgment.
- **Convergence** — Close phase: criteria, ranking, selection; then [Decision-Making Frameworks](./Decision-Making-Frameworks.md) and [Prioritization](../Productivity-Techniques/Prioritization.md).

## Environment for Creativity

- **Space for incubation** — Step away; let ideas sit; see [Recovery & Rest](../Self-Management/Recovery-Rest.md).
- **Varied input** — Reading, conversations, and domains outside your usual; see [Reading & Information Consumption](./Reading-Information-Consumption.md).
- **Capture ideas** — Write them down so you can return; see [Learning & Knowledge Management](./Learning-Knowledge-Management.md) and [Task Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Task-Management.md) (someday/maybe).
- **Low pressure** — Experiment and “bad” first drafts; see [Procrastination](../Self-Management/Procrastination.md) and perfectionism.
