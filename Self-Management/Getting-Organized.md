# How to Be the Most Organized Person in the World

A practical guide to organizing physical spaces and digital life. Covers home, workspace, tech, email, and task management.

## Conquer the Kitchen

- Stow smaller utensils or food items in **labeled plastic containers or spare bowls**.
- **Group "like with like"** in cabinets.
- Store items **close to where you use them**.
- **Tip:** Store lids with one large container and stack other containers neatly by size.
- **Declutter:** Toss expired food, gooey Tupperware, empty water bottles — anything that has overstayed its welcome.

## Tidy Up Your Bedroom

- Donate clothes and shoes you don't wear often.
- Hang jewelry, hats, and scarves from **wall hooks or ribbon board**.
- Consider an **extra closet rod or double hanging space**.
- Fold towels and accessories; use drawers or shelves. A hollow ottoman can add extra storage.
- **Tip:** After wearing an item, place it back with the hanger facing the **opposite direction**. At the end of the season, donate items still facing the original direction (unworn).

## Clean Out the Bathroom

- Throw out old makeup, dried-up creams, and expired medications.
- Use **shelves or adhesive cups** for combs, toothbrushes, and small toiletries.
- Use **stackable containers or silverware trays** to keep makeup neat.
- Stock extra toilet paper, towels, and hair dryers in a basket on the floor.
- **Tip:** Check the jar date (plastic tab). Once open, many products are good for about 36 months.

## Organize Your Desk

- **Frequently used items** → top drawer on the side of your dominant hand.
- **"Might-need" items** → lower drawers.
- Scan unnecessary paper bills and switch to electronic where possible.
- Toss unnecessary papers; keep important docs (financial statements, lease, tax returns).
- Plug all cords into **one power-surge protector** under the desk and secure with twist-ties.
- Consider a **small plastic shoe box** under the desk as a mini trash bin.
- Store loose files in a **collapsible storage file**, labeled by category.

## Tackle Your Tech

- **Delete** files you no longer need (e.g. old cover letters, outdated drafts).
- **Organize** remaining files into desktop folders by date or subject.
- **Nest** sub-folders inside larger folders (e.g. break "2024" into months).
- **Back up** files to keep them safe and secure.

## Own Your Email

*Hit inbox zero with these productivity habits (Gmail-oriented but adaptable to other services.)*

- **Archive everything** — Use search by keyword, sender, recipient, or date to find mail; you don't need everything in the inbox.
- **Use filters** — Send repeating, low-priority mail to preset folders; use labels and "hide unless unread."
- **Reminders** — Use a service like NudgeMail (or built-in snooze) for recurring or future follow-ups (e.g. "Follow up with Dana April 1st at 10 a.m.").
- **Remove distractions** — Disable desktop notifications, turn off email preview scans, and set phone sync to 15 minutes or longer.

For full email workflow and inbox zero method, see [Email & Communication Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Email-Communication-Management.md).

## Master Your To-Dos

Use a single, always-accessible doc (e.g. Google Doc) as your planner. Set it up with:

1. **Today's date**
2. **Today's schedule**
3. **To-dos**
4. **Ideas and thoughts** you don't want to forget
5. **Archive / Done** — Log what you accomplish so you can search for notes, tasks, or names later

For task methodologies (GTD, Eisenhower, Kanban), see [Task Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Task-Management.md).
