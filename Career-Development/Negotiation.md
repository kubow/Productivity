# Negotiation

## Overview

Negotiation is working with others to reach an agreement when interests partly align and partly conflict. It applies to salary, projects, deadlines, scope, and conflict. Good negotiation saves time, improves outcomes, and preserves relationships. See also [Conflict Resolution](../Interpersonal-Development/Conflict-Resolution.md), [Influence & Persuasion](../Interpersonal-Development/Influence-Persuasion.md), and [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).

## Why It Matters for Productivity

- **Outcomes** — Better terms (resources, timeline, scope) mean more realistic and successful work.
- **Time** — Clear agreements reduce rework and repeated discussions.
- **Relationships** — Fair, transparent negotiation builds trust; see [Networking and Relationship Building](../Interpersonal-Development/Networking-Relationship-Building.md) and [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md).
- **Stress** — Knowing you can negotiate reduces anxiety about saying yes to bad deals; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md).

## Principles

### Focus on Interests, Not Only Positions

- **Position** — “I need this by Friday.”
- **Interest** — “I need time for review so we don’t ship bugs” or “I have a hard deadline with the client.”
- Understanding interests opens options: different dates, earlier handoff, or different scope. See [Conflict Resolution](../Interpersonal-Development/Conflict-Resolution.md) and [Creative Thinking](../Personal-Development/Creative-Thinking.md).

### Prepare

- What do you want? What do they likely want?
- What’s your best alternative if you don’t agree (BATNA)? Knowing this helps you know when to walk away.
- What can you offer? What might they offer? See [Decision-Making Frameworks](../Personal-Development/Decision-Making-Frameworks.md).

### Listen and Clarify

- Ask questions; don’t assume. See [Effective Listening](../Interpersonal-Development/Effective-Listening.md).
- Paraphrase to confirm understanding; uncover constraints and priorities.
- Information is power; share what helps build a good deal without giving away unnecessary leverage.

### Propose and Explore Options

- Propose a concrete option; invite their view.
- Generate several options when possible (“We could do A, B, or C”); see [Creative Thinking](../Personal-Development/Creative-Thinking.md).
- Be willing to adjust; aim for “good enough” and fair, not “winning” at their expense.

### Be Clear and Respectful

- State what you need and why; avoid aggression or passive aggression.
- Respect [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md)—yours and theirs; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md) for saying no clearly.
- If you can’t agree, say so and suggest next steps (e.g. another conversation, a different decision-maker).

## Common Situations

- **Salary and conditions** — Know your value and alternatives; prepare; listen to their constraints; see [Job Interview Guide](./Job-Interview.md) and [Personal Branding](./Personal-Branding.md).
- **Deadlines and scope** — Trade scope for time when possible; make trade-offs explicit; see [Project Management Basics](./Project-Management-Basics.md) and [Delegation](./Delegation.md).
- **Conflict** — Use interest-based approach; see [Conflict Resolution](../Interpersonal-Development/Conflict-Resolution.md) and [Feedback](../Interpersonal-Development/Feedback.md).
- **Saying no to requests** — “I can’t do X; I can do Y” or “Not now, but later”; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md) and [Prioritization](../Productivity-Techniques/Prioritization.md).

## When Negotiation Is Hard

- **Power imbalance** — Prepare BATNA; get advice or support; focus on interests and options.
- **Emotion** — Pause if needed; listen; separate people from problem; see [Conflict Resolution](../Interpersonal-Development/Conflict-Resolution.md) and [Stress Management Techniques](../Self-Management/Stress-Management-Techniques.md).
- **Culture and style** — Adapt to direct vs. indirect norms without abandoning your [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md) or ethics.
