# Planning Ritual (Daily & Weekly)

## Overview

A short, regular planning ritual keeps priorities visible and reduces reactive drift. It ties together [Goal Setting](../Self-Management/Goal-Setting.md), [Task Management](./Task-Management.md), [Prioritization](./Prioritization.md), and [Review & Reflection Systems](../Self-Management/Review-Reflection-Systems.md).

## Weekly Planning

### When

- End of previous week or start of the new one (e.g. Friday afternoon or Monday morning).
- Block 30–60 min so it doesn’t get skipped; see [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](./Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).

### What to Do

1. **Review last week** — What was done? What slipped? What did you learn? (Can use [Review & Reflection Systems](../Self-Management/Review-Reflection-Systems.md) prompts.)
2. **Check goals** — What’s the focus for this week from [Goal Setting](../Self-Management/Goal-Setting.md) or OKRs?
3. **List commitments** — Meetings, deadlines, and must-dos from [Task Management](./Task-Management.md).
4. **Choose priorities** — Top 3–5 outcomes or themes for the week; see [Prioritization](./Prioritization.md).
5. **Block time** — Put deep work, key tasks, and recovery in the calendar; protect focus time; see [Deep Work & Focus](./Deep-Work-Focus.md), [Routines](../Self-Management/Routines.md).
6. **Note risks** — What could derail the week? Plan mitigation or trade-offs.

### Outcome

- A week that reflects your priorities, not only others’ requests.
- Fewer surprises and less last-minute overload.

## Daily Planning

### When

- End of previous day (shutdown) or start of day (e.g. part of [Routines](../Self-Management/Routines.md)).
- 5–15 min.

### What to Do

1. **Review today** — What’s already scheduled (meetings, blocks)?
2. **Pick top 3 (or 1 + 2)** — The few things that would make the day successful; see [Prioritization](./Prioritization.md).
3. **Clarify first action** — For the first priority, what’s the very next step? Reduces [Procrastination](../Self-Management/Procrastination.md).
4. **Check energy** — If you know your peaks (see [Energy Management](../Self-Management/Energy-Management.md)), align the hardest task with them.
5. **Optional** — Quick [Review & Reflection Systems](../Self-Management/Review-Reflection-Systems.md): one thing to be grateful for or one lesson from yesterday.

### Outcome

- Clear focus for the day and a concrete first step.
- Less decision fatigue once work starts.

## Shutdown Ritual (Evening)

- Quick review: what’s done, what’s left.
- Write 3 (or fewer) items for tomorrow so you can disconnect; see [Routines](../Self-Management/Routines.md) and [Work-Life Integration](../Self-Management/Work-Life-Integration.md).
- Close work apps and email so the next day starts from a clean slate.
