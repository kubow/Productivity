# Meeting Effectiveness

## Overview

Meetings can align teams and decide quickly—or consume time without outcome. Effective meetings have a clear purpose, the right people, and a structure that leads to decisions and follow-up. See also [Email & Communication Management](./Email-Communication-Management.md) for when to use meetings vs other channels.

## When to Have a Meeting

- **Need real-time discussion** — Ideas, debate, or alignment that async can’t do well.
- **Need decisions** — Stakeholders together to commit.
- **Need relationship or nuance** — Sensitive topics, conflict, or complex coordination.
- **Need shared understanding** — Kickoffs, retrospectives, or complex briefings.

## When Not to Meet

- **Information that could be a doc or email** — Send a summary; offer optional Q&A.
- **Status updates only** — Prefer async (email, doc, short video, or chat).
- **One-way broadcast** — Record or write it; people can consume when it suits them.
- **No clear outcome** — If you can’t state “By the end we will have X,” reconsider.

## Design and Run Effective Meetings

### Before

- **Purpose and outcome** — One sentence: “By the end we will have decided X” or “agreed on Y.”
- **Agenda** — Items with time; share in advance so people can prepare.
- **Right people** — Only those needed for the outcome; others get notes or recording.
- **Length** — Short by default (e.g. 25 or 50 min); long only when necessary.
- **Prep** — Pre-reads or inputs so the meeting is for discussion, not reading.

### During

- **Start on time** — Don’t reward lateness by repeating.
- **State purpose and outcome** — Remind everyone why we’re here.
- **Facilitate** — Keep to agenda; park off-topic items; include quiet voices.
- **Decide** — Explicit decisions and owners; no vague “we’ll figure it out.”
- **End on time** — Summarize decisions and next steps; then stop.

### After

- **Notes and actions** — Who does what by when; share quickly.
- **Follow-up** — Track commitments; mention in the next meeting or in [Task Management](./Task-Management.md).

## Meeting-Free Time

- **Focus blocks** — Protect blocks with no meetings for deep work; see [Deep Work & Focus](./Deep-Work-Focus.md) and [Time Blocking & Calendar Management](./Time-Blocking-Calendar-Management.md).
- **No-meeting days** — e.g. One day a week without meetings (or only 1:1s).
- **Policies** — “No meeting” or “focus” hours that the team respects.

## Declining and Reducing

- **Decline** when there’s no clear purpose, no agenda, or you’re not needed for the outcome.
- **Suggest alternatives** — Async doc, quick chat, or smaller sync.
- See [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md) and [Email & Communication Management](./Email-Communication-Management.md) (Meeting vs. email vs. chat).
