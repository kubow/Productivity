# Goal Setting & Achievement Systems

## Overview

Goal setting is the foundation of productivity. Without clear goals, it's difficult to measure progress or know what to prioritize.

## Frameworks

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
- **Objectives**: Qualitative, inspirational goals
- **Key Results**: Quantitative measures of success
- Typically set quarterly
- 3-5 OKRs per cycle

### HARD Goals
- **Heartfelt**: Emotionally connected
- **Animated**: Vividly imagined
- **Required**: Necessary for success
- **Difficult**: Challenging but achievable

## Goal Hierarchy

- **Life Goals**: Long-term vision (5-10 years)
- **Annual Goals**: Yearly objectives
- **Quarterly Goals**: 90-day focus areas
- **Monthly Goals**: Monthly milestones
- **Weekly Goals**: Weekly targets
