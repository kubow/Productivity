# Burnout Prevention & Recovery

## Overview

Burnout is prolonged stress leading to exhaustion, cynicism or detachment, and reduced effectiveness. Preventing it and recovering when it occurs protects long-term productivity and well-being.

## Signs of Burnout

- **Exhaustion** — Physical and emotional fatigue that rest doesn’t fix
- **Cynicism / detachment** — Feeling disconnected from work, colleagues, or purpose
- **Reduced performance** — Harder to focus, more mistakes, missed deadlines
- **Irritability** — Short fuse, resentment, withdrawal
- **Health issues** — Sleep problems, illness, headaches

## Prevention

### Boundaries

- Define work hours and stick to them; disconnect after hours.
- Say no to nonessential commitments; see [Saying No](../Interpersonal-Development/Saying-No.md) and [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md).
- Protect focus time and recovery; see [Work-Life Integration](./Work-Life-Integration.md).

### Sustainable Load

- Align commitments with capacity; avoid chronic overcommitment.
- Delegate where possible; see [Delegation](../Career-Development/Delegation.md).
- Use [Prioritization](../Productivity-Techniques/Prioritization.md) and [Task Management](../Productivity-Techniques/Task-Management.md) so “must-do” is realistic.

### Recovery and Rest

- Schedule rest, breaks, and time off; treat them as non-negotiable.
- See [Recovery & Rest](./Recovery-Rest.md), [Stress Management](./Stress-Management-Techniques.md), [Energy Management](./Energy-Management.md), [Sleep](./sleep/Sleep.md).

### Meaning and Control

- Connect tasks to purpose and values.
- Increase control where you can (how, when, or where you work).
- Build in small wins and progress; see [Goal Setting](./Goal-Setting.md) and [Review & Reflection Systems](./Review-Reflection-Systems.md).

### Support

- Maintain relationships and ask for help.
- Use [Feedback](../Interpersonal-Development/Feedback.md) and [Conflict Resolution](../Interpersonal-Development/Conflict-Resolution.md) to address issues early.

## Recovery (When Burnout Has Set In)

- **Acknowledge it** — Name burnout and its impact instead of pushing harder.
- **Reduce load** — Drop, defer, or delegate nonessential work; protect rest.
- **Rest** — More sleep, downtime, and boundaries; limit work-related contact off-hours.
- **Reconnect** — Time with people and activities that restore you.
- **Reflect** — What drove the overload? What boundaries or habits need to change?
- **Seek support** — Manager, HR, mentor, or mental health professional as needed.
