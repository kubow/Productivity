# Decision-Making Frameworks

## Overview

Structured approaches to making better decisions, complementing bias recognition.

## Decision Frameworks

### Decision Trees
- Visual representation of choices
- Probability and outcomes
- Expected value calculations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- List all costs
- List all benefits
- Quantify where possible
- Compare and decide

### Pros and Cons
- Simple but effective
- Weighted pros and cons
- Consider short and long-term

### Decision Matrix
- List criteria
- Weight importance
- Score options
- Calculate weighted scores

### Six Thinking Hats (Edward de Bono)
- White: Facts and information
- Red: Emotions and feelings
- Black: Critical judgment
- Yellow: Optimism and benefits
- Green: Creativity and alternatives
- Blue: Process control

## Mental Models

Building on Charlie Munger's work:
- First principles thinking
- Second-order thinking
- Inversion
- Occam's Razor
- Hanlon's Razor
- And many more...

## Decision Process

1. **Define the problem**: What decision needs to be made?
2. **Gather information**: What do you need to know?
3. **Identify alternatives**: What are your options?
4. **Evaluate alternatives**: Use frameworks above
5. **Choose**: Make the decision
6. **Take action**: Implement
7. **Review**: Learn from outcomes

## Common Pitfalls

- Analysis paralysis
- Confirmation bias
- Anchoring
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Status quo bias
