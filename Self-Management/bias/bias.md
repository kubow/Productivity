# Cognitive Biases & Distortions

## Overview

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. They affect our decision-making processes and can lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

Understanding these biases helps us make better decisions, improve our thinking, and recognize when our judgment might be compromised.

The content below unifies biases from multiple sources: "20 Cognitive Biases That Screw Up Your Decisions" (Business Insider), "10 Cognitive Biases That Affect Decision-Making", "24 Cognitive Biases - Know Thyself", and "Cognitive Distortions Examples".

## Core Cognitive Biases

### 1. Anchoring Bias

**Description:** People are over-reliant on the first piece of information they hear, which sets a range of possibilities. The first thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows.

**How It Works:** Human minds are associative, and initial information (like a price in financial negotiations) has a significant effect on subsequent judgments.

**Example:** When negotiating salaries, the first number mentioned often becomes the anchor point for the entire negotiation, even if it's not the most relevant.

**Mitigation:** Be aware of initial information and consciously consider a wider range of possibilities.

---

### 2. Availability Heuristic

**Description:** People overestimate the importance of easily available information, often ignoring broader data. Your judgments are influenced by what springs most easily to mind.

**How It Works:** Recent, emotionally powerful, or unusual memories can seem more relevant than they actually are.

**Example:** Heavy drinkers or smokers often argue with doctors about negative health effects, claiming their grandfather died peacefully at 102 despite heavy drinking/smoking, because that one example is more memorable than statistical data.

**Mitigation:** Try to gain different perspectives and relevant statistical information rather than relying purely on first judgments and emotive influences.

---

### 3. Bandwagon Effect

**Description:** The probability of adopting a belief increases with the number of people who already hold it, leading to groupthink. People tend to follow other people.

**How It Works:** In meetings, the more people have the same opinion, the more others will tend to adopt it as well.

**Example:** Group thinking may be one of the reasons why meetings are such a waste of time - people conform to the group rather than thinking independently.

**Mitigation:** Encourage independent thinking before group discussions. Seek diverse perspectives.

---

### 4. Blind-Spot Bias

**Description:** The bias of failing to recognize one's own cognitive biases, while easily noticing them in others.

**How It Works:** It is much easier to watch others and recognize what they do well (or not) than to actually recognize one's own cognitive biases.

**Mitigation:** Actively seek feedback and be open to the possibility that you have biases you're not aware of.

---

### 5. Choice-Supportive Bias

**Description:** Tendency to feel positive about a choice, even if it has flaws, simply because one made it. We tend to stick to choices we made although they might have been completely wrong.

**Example:** You may think your colleague is a great doctor even if you often need to adjust medication doses prescribed by them to avoid overdose.

**Mitigation:** Regularly review past decisions objectively and be willing to change course when needed.

---

### 6. Clustering Illusion

**Description:** The tendency to perceive patterns in random events, often seen in gambling fallacies.

**Example:** Doctors sometimes make bad decisions after seeing lots of patients with the same disease - they think the symptoms are similar and follow a certain pattern, while in reality it is far from being true.

**Mitigation:** Look for statistical evidence rather than relying on perceived patterns. Understand randomness.

---

### 7. Confirmation Bias

**Description:** Tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's existing preconceptions. You look for ways to justify your existing beliefs.

**How It Works:** We automatically fit new information into existing narratives and dismiss contradictory data.

**Example:** People suffering from this bias tend to be terrible teachers, scientists, or doctors because they only listen to information that confirms their preconceptions.

**Quote:** "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool" - Richard Feynman

**Mitigation:** Actively seek out disconfirming evidence. Challenge your own beliefs regularly.

---

### 8. Conservatism Bias

**Description:** Favoring prior evidence over new information, leading to slow acceptance of new facts.

**Example:** We are slow to accept that cholesterol might actually not be so bad for our heart as we used to be taught that it should be avoided at all cost if we wanted to decrease a risk of having a heart attack.

**Mitigation:** Be open to updating your beliefs when new, credible evidence emerges.

---

### 9. Information Bias

**Description:** Seeking information even when it doesn't affect action, believing more information is always better.

**How It Works:** Information overload is a reality and we sometimes search for more information on a topic although we actually do not need to do so. Too much information then harms our decision making capability.

**Mitigation:** Determine what information is actually needed for the decision at hand. Set limits on information gathering.

---

### 10. Ostrich Effect

**Description:** The decision to ignore dangerous or negative information by "burying one's head in the sand."

**How It Works:** Ostrich likes to hide their head in the sand if he fears or does not like something. We, humans, tend to act in the similar way when making decisions.

**Mitigation:** Face difficult information head-on. Ignoring problems doesn't make them go away.

---

### 11. Outcome Bias

**Description:** Judging a decision based on its outcome rather than the quality of the decision-making process itself.

**Example:** Many people base their decisions on past outcomes. But just because a patient survived a meningitis without being given any antibiotics does not mean that skipping antibiotics was a smart decision.

**Mitigation:** Evaluate decisions based on the information available at the time, not just the outcome.

---

### 12. Overconfidence

**Description:** Being overly confident about one's abilities, leading to greater risk-taking.

**Example:** Some people like taking great risks in their daily lives as they are over confident about their abilities. Famous doctors or scientists tend to suffer from over confidence much more than normal people as they are convinced that they are always right. However a disaster usually strikes when we get too confident.

**Mitigation:** Regularly calibrate your confidence with actual outcomes. Seek feedback.

---

### 13. Placebo Effect

**Description:** When believing something will have an effect causes it to have that effect, even if it's inert.

**How It Works:** Placebo effect is known in medicine and it means that people believe that by taking a fake pill with no active ingredient they will experience the same results as patients given the actual medication with the active ingredient.

**Note:** The placebo effect works for mind-influenced things like pain, but not for viruses or broken bones.

**Mitigation:** Keep a healthy body and bank balance by using evidence-based medicine from a qualified doctor.

---

### 14. Pro-Innovation Bias

**Description:** Overvaluing an innovation's usefulness while undervaluing its limitations.

**Example:** Scientists are frequently victim of this bias. They tend to overvalue usefulness of their inventions while undervaluing their limitations.

**Mitigation:** Critically evaluate both benefits and limitations of new innovations.

---

### 15. Recency Bias

**Description:** Weighing the latest information more heavily than older data, leading to unwise decisions.

**Example:** Sometimes we tend to value new information more than the old information. In research this may mean that doctors may stop using aspirin for fever treatment and start using NSAIDs (ignoring the fact that aspirin actually does less harm to the gut than NSAIDs).

**Mitigation:** Consider the full historical context, not just recent information.

---

### 16. Salience

**Description:** Focusing on the most easily recognizable or striking features of a person or concept, often distorting perception of risk.

**Example:** When thinking about a graduation exam you may worry about not passing the exam because of the fact that you forgot your exam brochure - which is a pre-requisite for being able to take the exam – at home while statistically it is much more likely that you will not pass the exam because of the fact that you will not answer the questions correctly.

**Mitigation:** Look beyond the most obvious or striking features. Consider statistical probabilities.

---

### 17. Selective Perception

**Description:** Allowing one's expectations to influence how the world is perceived.

**How It Works:** We tend to let our expectations affect our way of perception of the world. A bad guy will always expect the worst while a good guy usually expects the best.

**Mitigation:** Be aware of your expectations and how they might color your perception.

---

### 18. Stereotyping

**Description:** Expecting a group or person to have certain qualities without real information, often overused and abused.

**Example:** Sometimes we tend to expect that products have certain qualities without actually having any supporting information. Such expectations are good to identify products as useful or useless but we should not abuse or overuse this strategy.

**Mitigation:** Base judgments on actual information about individuals, not group stereotypes.

---

### 19. Survivorship Bias

**Description:** Focusing only on surviving examples, leading to a misjudgment of a situation by ignoring failures.

**Example:** Sometimes we misjudge a situation as we only make decisions based on examples made available to us. For instance you may buy a great business course, which should teach you how to earn one million bucks in a year selling products on Amazon, yet when you actually buy the course and follow the instructions you will learn that becoming rich is not that easy as you did not have all information before purchasing the course (e.g. mainly information about the majority of purchasers, who actually purchased the course and failed to earn a dime).

**Mitigation:** Look at both successes and failures. Consider the full sample, not just survivors.

---

### 20. Zero-Risk Bias

**Description:** A preference for eliminating risk entirely, even if it's counterproductive, due to a love of certainty.

**How It Works:** People tend to love certainty even if it is not good for them. We think that by eliminating all risks there is no chance of any harm being caused.

**Mitigation:** Accept that some risk is necessary and beneficial. Evaluate risk-reward tradeoffs.

---

## Additional Cognitive Biases

### 21. Hindsight Bias

**Description:** Also known as the "knew-it-all-along" effect, it leads people to perceive past events as being predictable and obvious, even if they were not at the time.

**Mitigation:** Remember that outcomes seem obvious only after the fact. Document your predictions before events occur.

---

### 22. Fundamental Attribution Error

**Description:** You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation. It leads people to attribute the behavior of others to their character or personality, rather than considering external factors or situational influences.

**Example:** We attribute others' slowness to character flaws, but our own to situational factors (e.g., lack of sleep).

**Mitigation:** It's not only kind to view others' situations with charity, it's more objective too. Consider situational factors for others' behavior.

---

### 23. Loss Aversion

**Description:** It leads people to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, often resulting in risk-averse behavior.

**How It Works:** The pain of loss is felt more keenly than the gratification of pleasant things.

**Mitigation:** Use pro-and-con lists, and think in terms of probabilities to evaluate things more objectively.

---

### 24. Dunning-Kruger Effect

**Description:** People with low ability in a task overestimate their ability, often due to a lack of self-awareness and metacognitive skills. The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be.

**How It Works:** Experts underestimate their ability, while those with simple ideas are over-confident.

**Quote:** "The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are so certain of themselves, yet wiser people so full of doubts." - Bertrand Russell

**Mitigation:** Recognize the limits of your knowledge. The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know.

---

### 25. Framing Effect

**Description:** It occurs when people's decisions are influenced by the way information is presented or "framed," rather than the actual content of the information. You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery.

**How It Works:** Everyone is influenced by framing and subtle cues, which is why the ad industry exists.

**Mitigation:** Only when we have the intellectual humility to accept the fact that we can be manipulated, can we hope to limit how much we are. Focus on the actual content, not just the presentation.

---

### 26. Self-Serving Bias

**Description:** It leads people to attribute their successes to their own abilities and efforts, while blaming their failures on external factors or bad luck. You believe your failures are due to external factors, yet you're personally responsible for your successes.

**How It Works:** People often attribute success to themselves and blame circumstances for failures.

**Mitigation:** When judging others, be mindful of its interaction with the just-world hypothesis, fundamental attribution error, and in-group bias. Take responsibility for both successes and failures.

---

### 27. Curse of Knowledge

**Description:** Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone.

**How It Works:** It highlights the difficulty of remembering why something wasn't obvious before.

**Mitigation:** When teaching, go slow and explain like they're ten years old (without being patronizing). Repeat key points and facilitate active practice to help embed knowledge.

---

### 28. Belief Bias

**Description:** If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you'll rationalize anything that supports it. This makes ideas impervious to criticism.

**Mitigation:** Ask "when and how did I get this belief?" to question ideas. Challenge your beliefs regularly.

---

### 29. Backfire Effect

**Description:** When your core beliefs are challenged, it can cause you to believe even more strongly.

**How It Works:** Challenges can feel like an attack on identity, leading to motivated reasoning.

**Quote:** "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so." - Mark Twain

**Mitigation:** Separate your identity from your beliefs. Be open to changing your mind when presented with evidence.

---

### 30. Barnum Effect

**Description:** You see personal specifics in vague statements by filling in the gaps. Minds make connections to interpret nebulous statements as specific and personal.

**Example:** Psychics and astrologers use this bias.

**Mitigation:** Recognize that vague statements can apply to anyone. Look for specific, testable claims.

---

### 31. Groupthink

**Description:** You let the social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes. Dissent is uncomfortable, and the most confident voice often determines decisions.

**Mitigation:** Rather than openly contradicting others, seek to facilitate objective means of evaluation and critical thinking practices as a group activity. Encourage diverse perspectives.

---

### 32. Negativity Bias

**Description:** You allow negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.

**How It Works:** The pain of loss is felt more keenly than the gratification of pleasant things.

**Mitigation:** Pro-and-con lists, as well as thinking in terms of probabilities, can help you evaluate things more objectively than relying on a cognitive impression.

---

### 33. Declinism

**Description:** You see the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than is likely.

**How It Works:** Despite living in peaceful times, many believe things are worsening, possibly due to the 24-hour news cycle.

**Mitigation:** Instead of relying on nostalgic impressions, use measurable metrics such as life expectancy, levels of crime and violence, and prosperity statistics.

---

### 34. Halo Effect

**Description:** How much you like someone, influences your other judgments of them.

**How It Works:** Judgments are associative and automatic, requiring conscious control for objectivity, especially in professional settings.

**Mitigation:** It's only through becoming aware of them that we can mitigate their effects. Separate different aspects of evaluation.

---

### 35. Just World Hypothesis

**Description:** Your preference for a just world makes you presume that it exists. The idea that people get what they deserve is comforting but not always true.

**Mitigation:** Remember that everyone has their own life story, we're all fallible, and bad things happen to good people.

---

### 36. In-Group Bias

**Description:** You unfairly favor those who belong to your group. We automatically favor those most like us.

**Mitigation:** Try to imagine yourself in the position of those in out-groups; whilst also attempting to be dispassionate when judging those who belong to your in-groups.

---

### 37. Bystander Effect

**Description:** You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.

**How It Works:** In public settings, shock and mental paralysis can lead to a sense of deindividuation.

**Mitigation:** If there's an emergency situation, presume to be the one who will help or call for help. Be the change you want to see in the world.

---

### 38. Optimism Bias

**Description:** You overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes.

**How It Works:** While a positive attitude has benefits, it can hinder rational judgments.

**Mitigation:** If you make rational, realistic judgments you'll have a lot more to feel positive about.

---

### 39. Reactance

**Description:** You'd rather do the opposite of what someone is trying to make you do.

**How It Works:** When liberty is constrained, there's an inclination to resist, sometimes leading to over-compensation.

**Mitigation:** Be careful not to lose objectivity when someone is being coercive/manipulative, or trying to force you do something. Wisdom springs from reflection, folly from reaction.

---

### 40. Pessimism Bias

**Description:** You overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes.

**How It Works:** Often a defense mechanism or a result of depression/anxiety.

**Note:** Perhaps the worst aspect of pessimism is that even if something good happens, you'll probably feel pessimistic about it anyway.

**Mitigation:** Seek professional help if this is affecting your life significantly. Practice cognitive restructuring.

---

### 41. Spotlight Effect

**Description:** You overestimate how much people notice how you look and act.

**How It Works:** Most people are more concerned about themselves.

**Mitigation:** Instead of worrying about how you're being judged, consider how you make others feel. They'll remember this much more, and you'll make the world a better place.

---

### 42. Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Description:** Continuing to invest in something because you have already invested in it, even when it's not the best option. Past investments (time, money, effort) are used to justify continuing rather than cutting losses.

**How It Works:** We feel that abandoning a project means "wasting" what we've already put in, so we keep going despite better alternatives.

**Example:** Staying in a bad relationship, finishing a pointless project, or holding a losing investment because of what you've already put in.

**Mitigation:** Evaluate decisions based on future costs and benefits only. Ask "Would I start this today?"—if not, consider exiting. Ignore sunk costs when choosing what to do next.

---

## Cognitive Distortions

Cognitive distortions are exaggerated or irrational thought patterns that are believed to perpetuate the effects of psychopathological states, especially depression and anxiety.

### 1. Polarized Thinking (All-or-Nothing Thinking)

**Description:** Viewing situations in absolute, black-and-white terms with no middle ground.

**Example:** A student who gets an A- on an exam feels like a failure because they are used to getting A+ grades only. They have the mentality, "If I am not successful at everything I do, I am a complete failure."

**Mitigation:** Recognize that most situations exist on a spectrum. Look for shades of gray.

---

### 2. Mental Filtering

**Description:** Focusing exclusively on negative details while filtering out positive aspects.

**Sub-types:**

#### Negative Mental Filtering
**Example:** An employee receives a good performance review but focuses on one negative comment their manager made about them.

#### Disqualifying the Positive
**Example:** A student gets a good grade but overlooks it and tries to explain their good grade as simply luck or fluke instead of hard work.

**Mitigation:** Actively look for positive aspects. Balance your perspective.

---

### 3. Overgeneralization

**Description:** Drawing broad conclusions from a single incident or piece of evidence.

**Example:** A student receives a bad grade on one exam, based on this they think they are stupid and a failure and believe that all future exams they will get a bad grade as well.

**Mitigation:** Recognize that one event doesn't define everything. Look for counterexamples.

---

### 4. Jumping to Conclusions

**Description:** Making negative interpretations without definite facts to support the conclusion.

**Sub-types:**

#### Mind Reading
**Example:** A friend you are spending time with seems distracted or uninterested. You jump to the conclusion it has to do with you.

#### Fortune Telling
**Example:** You have a date but you predict that the date will go bad. You make assumptions about the date before it has occurred.

**Mitigation:** Gather evidence before drawing conclusions. Ask questions rather than assuming.

---

### 5. Catastrophizing (Magnification/Minimization)

**Description:** Exaggerating the importance of negative events or personal shortcomings, or minimizing the importance of positive events.

**Sub-types:**

#### Magnification
**Example:** A person's lunch date is running late and assumes the worst. Their worries escalate quickly & thoughts become exaggerated.

#### Minimization
**Example:** An athlete wins an award but does not acknowledge their accomplishment. They minimize the importance of the award.

**Mitigation:** Put events in perspective. Consider the actual likelihood and impact of negative outcomes.

---

### 6. Personalization

**Description:** Believing that you are responsible for events outside of your control, or that external events have a personal meaning.

**Example:** You attend a party but all your friends are busy engaging with other people. You feel like they do not have any interest in being your friend and engaging in conversation with you. This makes you think you don't belong or are unfairly excluded.

**Mitigation:** Recognize that not everything is about you. Consider alternative explanations.

---

### 7. Blaming

**Description:** Placing blame for relationship issues or problems on others instead of sharing responsibility.

**Example:** Placing blame for relationship issues on your partner instead of sharing the responsibility for actions taken by both partners. You assume the victim mentality and think everything they do is to hurt you.

**Mitigation:** Take responsibility for your part. Recognize that most situations involve multiple factors.

---

## How to Mitigate Cognitive Biases and Distortions

### General Strategies

1. **Awareness:** The first step is recognizing that biases exist and affect everyone
2. **Slow Down:** Take time to think through decisions rather than relying on quick judgments
3. **Seek Diverse Perspectives:** Actively look for viewpoints different from your own
4. **Question Your Assumptions:** Regularly challenge your beliefs and thought patterns
5. **Use Decision-Making Frameworks:** Apply structured approaches to important decisions
6. **Gather Evidence:** Base decisions on data and facts, not just impressions
7. **Consider Alternatives:** Actively think about alternative explanations and outcomes
8. **Get Feedback:** Ask others for their perspectives on your thinking
9. **Document Predictions:** Write down your expectations before events occur
10. **Regular Review:** Periodically review past decisions to learn from them

### For Specific Situations

- **For Important Decisions:** Use structured decision-making processes
- **For Group Decisions:** Encourage independent thinking before group discussion
- **For Personal Judgments:** Consider situational factors and alternative explanations
- **For Information Consumption:** Seek diverse sources and verify claims
- **For Self-Evaluation:** Compare your confidence with actual outcomes
