## Overview

Effective learning and knowledge management systems help you retain information, connect ideas, and build a second brain.

## Note-Taking Systems

### Zettelkasten Method
- Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- Permanent notes
- Literature notes
- Fleeting notes
- Linking between notes

### Cornell Method
- Divide page into sections
- Notes area
- Cue column
- Summary section

### Outline Method
- Hierarchical structure
- Main topics and subtopics
- Easy to review

### Mind Mapping
- Visual representation
- Central idea with branches

## Learning Techniques

### Spaced Repetition
- Review information at increasing intervals
- Based on forgetting curve
- Tools: Anki, SuperMemo

### Active Recall
- Testing yourself
- Retrieval practice
- More effective than re-reading

### Feynman Technique
1. Choose a concept
2. Explain it simply
3. Identify gaps
4. Review and simplify

### Interleaving
- Mix different topics
- Better than blocking
- Improves transfer of learning

## Reading Strategies
