# Mindset, Resilience & Positivity

## Overview

How you interpret effort, failure, and feedback shapes learning, persistence, and productivity. Topics here: growth mindset, resilience, and positivity/gratitude—aligned with work like Carol Dweck’s *Mindset* and positive psychology.

## Growth Mindset

**Idea:** Abilities can be developed through effort, strategy, and input from others (vs. fixed traits).

### Beliefs and Behaviors

- **Challenges** — See as chances to learn, not threats.
- **Setbacks** — Treat as information: “What can I adjust?” not “I’m not good at this.”
- **Effort** — Value practice and deliberate effort as the path to improvement.
- **Feedback** — Seek and use criticism to improve.
- **Others’ success** — Learn from them instead of feeling threatened.

### Practical Shifts

- Replace “I can’t” with “I can’t yet” or “I haven’t learned how yet.”
- Ask after failures: “What did I learn? What will I try differently?”
- Set learning goals (e.g. “Learn to run a retrospective”) alongside outcome goals.

## Resilience

**Idea:** Bouncing back from difficulty and staying effective under stress.

### Practices

- **Reframe** — Look for alternative explanations and silver linings without denying reality.
- **Problem-solve** — Focus on what you can control and one next step.
- **Support** — Maintain relationships and ask for help; see [Networking and Relationship Building](../Interpersonal-Development/Networking-Relationship-Building.md) and [Boundaries](../Interpersonal-Development/Boundaries.md).
- **Recovery** — Rest, sleep, and boundaries; see [Stress Management](./Stress-Management-Techniques.md), [Work-Life Integration](./Work-Life-Integration.md), [Recovery & Rest](./Recovery-Rest.md).
- **Meaning** — Connect work to values and purpose to sustain motivation.

## Positivity and Gratitude

**Idea:** Intentionally noticing good things and expressing thanks to improve mood and outlook.

### Practices

- **Gratitude** — Regularly note 3 things you’re grateful for (e.g. daily or in [Review & Reflection Systems](./Review-Reflection-Systems.md)).
- **Savoring** — Pause to enjoy small wins and pleasant moments.
- **Kindness** — Small acts of kindness for others (and yourself).
- **Language** — Reduce constant complaining; name what’s going well.
- **Limits** — Positivity doesn’t mean ignoring problems; it pairs with honest reflection and action.
